# AI-Driven Biodiversity Insights for Swan Lake Park
A full-stack web application that delivers biodiversity insights specific to Swan Lake Park, powered by generative AI. The platform enables users to explore the parkâ€™s unique ecological landscape through intelligent data analysis and natural language generation. Community members can actively contribute by providing local biodiversity data, helping to enhance the accuracy and depth of insights.

## ðŸŒ± Motivation
Swan Lake Park is a cherished local amenity that serves as both a vital ecological habitat and a focal point for conservation efforts aimed at long-term environmental sustainability. Despite its importance, the park faces persistent environmental challenges. This AI-powered application harnesses the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to analyze data and provide relevant, accurate insights. These insights support data-driven decision-making, long-term planning, and public education, helping to raise awareness and guide conservation strategies.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start
The application is currently under development and will be deployed soon. Stay tuned for access to the Swan Lake Citizen Science Lab, where youâ€™ll be able to explore AI-powered biodiversity insights and contribute to ecological awareness at Swan Lake Park.
